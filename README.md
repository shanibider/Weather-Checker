# Backend Weather API Project 🌡 

The Backend Weather API Project is a backend-focused, aimed at providing developers with a simple and efficient way to access weather data for various locations.
Leveraging an external weather API service, this project sets up a backend system capable of handling client requests and delivering real-time weather information.

## Project Description 🎯:

The project includes the development of a backend server that acts as a mediator between clients and an external weather API service.
Upon receiving requests from clients, the backend server communicates with the weather API to retrieve relevant weather data for the specified location.
This data is then formatted and sent back to the clients in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML.

## Technologies Used 🖥:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,express,js,react,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

- [ ] **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- [ ]  **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for creating robust APIs and web servers.
- [ ]  **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for Node.js used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- [ ]  **Weather API Service**: An external weather API service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or Dark Sky) used for fetching weather data.
- [ ]  **RESTful API Design**: The backend server follows RESTful principles for designing its API endpoints, ensuring simplicity, scalability, and interoperability.
- [ ]  **JSON**: The data exchanged between the backend server and clients are typically formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data-interchange format.
